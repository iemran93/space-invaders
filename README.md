# Spcae Invaders

Space Invaders is a single player game where the player controls a spaceship that can move horizontally across the bottom of the screen and shoot at the aliens. The aliens move horizontally and vertically across the screen and the player must shoot them before there is a collision. The player has three lives and the game is over when the player runs out of lives.
